# bevy_northstar
## A 2d/3d hierarchical pathfinding crate for Bevy. 

`bevy_northstar` works by dividing the map into chunks and then calculates nodes based on the entrances between chunks. The nodes are used in pathfinding to get a higher level path that is significantly faster to calculate over long distances. Once the high level path is determined between a start and goal point it's refined to get a more accurate path.

### This crate is still a work in progress.

The crate is currently opinionated in the sense that it's not bring-your-own-grid. That may change in the future.

## Flags
This crate has the following Cargo features:

- `stats`: Enables pathfinding benchmarks. Useful to get an idea of how much time it's using per frame.

## Features  
- **Supports 2D and 3D Tilemaps** – Supports 2d and 3d tilemaps.  

- **Optimized Performance** – Algorithms are heavily benchmarked for efficiency.  

- **Gizmo Debug View** – Debug visuals for verifying the built HPA graph. Pathing debug components to visualize an entities path.  

- **Stress Tests** – 128x128 map with 128 entities to stress test HPA vs A* and collision. A collision example is provided to stress test narrow pathing.

- **Dynamic Collision & Avoidance** – For moving colliders attaching a simple Blocking marker component is all that's needed. If you use the built in systems the pathing will do a configurable look ahead to see if it can do a fast local A* reroute.

- **Bevy Systems Integration** – Bevy systems and components for pathfinding as well as collision markers when avoidance paths fail.

## Roadmap / TODO
- **Code & Documentation Cleanup** – Refine and document the API.
- **Basic Example** - Create a minimal example demonstrating only the basics usage for the crate. Move existing examples to stress tests.

  
- **Modify & Rebuild Grid Chunks Dynamically** – Support updates to the grid after it’s been built.    
- **Pseudo-3D Tilemap Support** – Add support for features like stairs and ramps without full 3D calculations.  
- **Parallelized Graph Building** – Speed up grid/graph construction using parallelism.  
- **Add Support For Multiple HPA Levels** – Implement multiple hierarchical levels for improved efficiency.  
- **Optimize 3D Performance** – 3d grids appear to take a performance hit higher than expected currently.
